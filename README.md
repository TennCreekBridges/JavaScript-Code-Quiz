## INTRODUCTION
This is a simple, timed multiple-choice quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores and displays high scores.

This timed code quiz consists of multiple-choice questions. The app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code, JQuery & Bootstrap. It features a clean and polished user interface and responsively adapts to multiple screen sizes.

The initial instructions are displayed. When the user clicks the start button, the timer begins counting down from 60 seconds in one second increments and quetions are presented. When they are answered, a new question appears. If the answer is correct, ten seconds are added to the score. If the answer is incorrect, ten seconds are deducted from the score.

When all questions are answered or timer reaches zero, the game is over. The user is then prompted to enter their initials and score, which are added to a ranked leaderboard. The scores may be cleared and/or the game started again.
